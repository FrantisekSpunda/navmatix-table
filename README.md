# Navmatix table

React + TypeScript + Vite application that should meet requirements of task from Navmatix

App contains table with data of American cities. The main requirement was to create a table managed by react-table package. Apply functionalities, like sorting, filtering, panination etc. just with react-table. I also applied react-query for client-side communication with API (this is an example, so I'm just using data from a JSON file).

Create whole project and become more familiar with libraries I didn't have so much experience with (react-table, bootstrap) took me around 5 hours. But most of time I was just struggling with bootstrap ðŸ˜„.

## important npm packages ðŸ“¦
- react
- typescript
- react-table
- react-query
- bootstrap

## How to run app
1. clone app with git or just download
2. run `npm i`
3. run `npm start`
4. open localhost in browser on the appropriate port
